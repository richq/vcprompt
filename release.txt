vcprompt release process
========================

* make sure "hg summary --remote" is clean (nothing uncommitted,
  synced with remote)

* read through README.txt and make sure it's still valid

* read the man page and make sure it's still valid:

    groff -Tascii -man vcprompt.1 | less

* commit any required changes

* clone on at least one different machine and run the tests:

    hg clone http://hg.gerg.ca/vcprompt
    cd vcprompt
    make grind      # requires valgrind
    make check      # if valgrind not installed

* select the version number, e.g.:

    ver=1.1

* tag the release and build the source tarball

    hg tag $ver
    hg archive -r $ver -t tgz -X ".hg*" /tmp/vcprompt-$ver.tar.gz

* test the tarball locally

    cd /tmp
    tar -xzf vcprompt-$ver.tar.gz
    cd vcprompt-$ver
    make grind

* copy to at least one different machine and test there

    host=<something>
    scp /tmp/vcprompt-$ver.tar.gz $host:/tmp
    ssh $host "cd /tmp && tar -xzf vcprompt-$ver.tar.gz && cd vcprompt-$ver && make check"

* push outgoing (tag) changeset

    hg push

* upload tarball to bitbucket from

    https://bitbucket.org/gward/vcprompt/downloads

* announce to mailing list (vcprompt-devel@googlegroups.com), e.g.:
